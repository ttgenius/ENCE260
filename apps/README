This directory contains a number of test applications contained in
their own sub-directories.  Each application has a numerical suffix.
As a rule, the larger the number the more difficult the program.

Within each sub-directory are two makefiles; one called Makefile and
the other called Makefile.test.  By default when make is run it will
read Makefile.

make           --- builds the application for the ATmega8
make program   --- programs the application into the ATmega8 flash memory
make clean     --- deletes the object and executable files


The other makefile, Makefile.test, will compile the application
natively for the PC with a test scaffold replacing the AVR dependent
modules.  This allows the application to be run and debugged on a PC.

make -f Makefile.test        --- builds the application for the PC
make -f Makefile.test clean  --- deletes the object and executable files


tone1  Play a continuous tone (if piezo tweeter connected)
tone2  Play a louder continuous tone (if piezo tweeter connected) by driving
       PIO pins in anti-phase
